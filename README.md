# Adobe Deactivation Bypass

This simple script allows you to bypass the Adobe Creative Cloud deactivation limit.

Note: This requires a cracked version of the Adobe software to work.

Remove this easily with this script:

### Known side effects

This might lead to some adobe-related sites (like Adobe Login and Adobe Stock) to not load. If this happens, remove the script temporarily using the `--remove` argument, then reapply when you want to use Adobe Software again.

## How to use

1. Download the script from the [releases page](https://github.com/YarosMallorca/adobe_deactivation_bypass/releases/latest)

2. Run the script:

   On Windows:

   - Open Terminal as Administrator
   - cd to the directory with the script exe file
   - Run the script: `.\adobe_deactivation_bypass_win.exe --apply`

   On macOS:

   - Open Terminal
   - cd to the directory where the script is located (usually it is your Downloads folder (```cd ~/Downloads```))
   - Make the script executable with `chmod +x adobe_deactivation_bypass_mac`
   - Run the script: `sudo ./adobe_deactivation_bypass_mac --apply`, you will have to change the command depending on the actual binary name, usually `adobe_deactivation_bypass_mac_arm`, or `adobe_deactivation_bypass_mac_intel`. 

3. Done! Enjoy your Adobe software without any limitations!
